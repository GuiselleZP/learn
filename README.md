In this repository , I save the files I use to learn different tools, which may
be useful for me in future projects.

### MongoDB
	
It is a NoSQL database system oriented to open source documentation.
Instead of daving the data in tables, as it is done in relational databases, 
MongoDB saves BSON data structres (a specification similar to JSON) with
dinamic scheme, making the integration of the data in certain applications 
easier and faster.
